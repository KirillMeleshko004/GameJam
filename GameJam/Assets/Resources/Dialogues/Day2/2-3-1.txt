Anna | Thank God at least you came.  

Mark | Did something happen?  

Derek | About half of the staff showed up for work today....  

Anna | Can people really just disappear like that?  

Derek | Yesterday was a day off, maybe they just had a good time.  

Anna | Wake up, Derek! We're talking about over 20 employees.  

Mark | Today a bus driver told me how people were going missing on his shift on the bus. 



Anna | In any case, it may be temporary. Orders are lower than usual today, too. 

Derek | At least there's a silver lining to all this missing stuff.  

Anna | If you're finding so much upside in this situation, you're not going to lose an extra minus in your paycheck.  

Derek | Mercy, darling. 


Derek | Or maybe to hell with it.  

Anna | What do you mean?  

Derek | I mean the job. If we're all going to disappear, let's take a honeymoon, we're almost out of work anyway. 
Derek | No one would mind if two more people disappeared from work.  

Anna | Don't make a big deal out of it. We'll think it's all temporary. I'd better get some coffee.


Derek | Don't thank me, buddy.  

Mark | You should have done it for your wife.  

Derek | You don't have to nag me in the evenings about little things. She'll brew it herself. She won't even drink my coffee at gunpoint.  

Mark | Women  

Derek | Women 


Mark | Anna's taking her time.  

Derek | I guess so. I'll go hurry her up. 




Mark | Still busy?  

Derek | She's not...  

Mark | Maybe she's gone somewhere?  

Derek | There was a cell phone and a wedding ring on the floor.  

Mark | I can't believe she lost her--  

Derek | Enough. We have work to do. She doesn't like it when we don't do anything.
