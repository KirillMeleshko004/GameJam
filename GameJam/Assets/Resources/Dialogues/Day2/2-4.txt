Mark | A colleague went missing at work today. 

Jozef | How did it happen?  

Mark | She just walked into the kitchen and disappeared. 

Jozef | Apparently the curse doesn't spare anyone.  

Mark | Curse? 

Jozef | What else would it be? A curse on technological advancement, no less.  

Mark | I can't believe we're gonna end up like this.  

Jozef | Did you ever imagine a circus show with fireworks or a great war?   

Mark | Better than this, I'm sure.  

Jozef | The world is unfair, but there's nothing we can do about it....
