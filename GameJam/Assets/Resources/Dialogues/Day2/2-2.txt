Jozef | Morning, Mark!  

Mark | You too.  

Jozef | Have you seen people go missing yet?  

Mark | Have you?  

Jozef | I work with people from morning till night. Yesterday, I was on my route and suddenly I heard a scream behind me. 

Jozef | I turned around and a woman had fainted on the bus. A young man at the beginning of the bus explained that a man was missing on the seat next to her.
Jozef | A scary sight, with only a couple of personal belongings left of him.  

Mark | And that's what happens nowadays.  

Jozef | Tell me about it. And on TV they keep feeding us news about how the scientists are investigating everything and fixing it.
Jozef | Probably their chief has already run away from shame and persecution.  

Mark | Or disappeared.
