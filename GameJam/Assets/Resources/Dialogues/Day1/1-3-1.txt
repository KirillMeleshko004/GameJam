Derek | What are you talking about? Just get to work and don't slack off. Let me at least finish my coffee, I have a headache.  

Anna | You shouldn't have been out drinking with Mark and the rest of the sales team.  

Derek | But you were there too, and everyone loved it.  

Anna | Yes, I was, and I tried to stop you. But you have to be the drunkest person at the meeting. And what are you wearing? I ironed your shirt this morning.  

Derek | Come on, a plain office shirt is not my style. Or maybe you're more into men in business office uniforms.  

Anna | It's a dress code, Derek. Take Mark's example, he drinks in moderation and he's always dressed appropriately. Here he is.  

Derek | Morning, coffee?  

Mark | I'd love one.  

Anna | Have you seen the news today?  

Mark | The one about the explosion at the research institute? It was horrible  

Derek | Yeah, Anna wanted to take the day off today, but she held back and came to work with me.  

Anna | Yeah, well, what do you expect from breakthrough technology? Okay, don't distract me, we have a lot of work to do today.  

Derek | Whatever you say, boss.
