Mark | See you tomorrow, Derek.  

Derek | You're leaving already?

Derek | Why don't you come over for dinner tonight?  

Mark | I'll say no, I'm still recovering from our last drink.  

Derek | You can't have too much to drink. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.  

Mark | Not leaving yet?  

Derek | It's taking Anna a long time to get ready as usual, we have to go together.  

Mark | See you tomorrow then.
