Jozef | It's morning again, Mark! I guess we're the last ones.  

Mark | As you can see.  

Jozef | Do you think we'll make it to the evening?  

Mark | Who knows?  

Jozef | I'm looking at you and I'm thinking. It's week 3 and you're still going to work like nothing happened. I'm getting motivated to ride the route.  

Mark | Glad to help.  

Jozef | I see we'll be at your stop soon, take care of yourself.  

Mark | Don't be so sudden, we'll see each other again tonight.  

Jozef | I hope so.
